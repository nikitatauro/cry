      <h3>WNBA</h3>
        <p>
          Attendance & viewership of WNBA
          games has been on a steady decline since 2002,
          making it increasingly hard to survive as an organization.
          Despite women's college basketball and NBA's popularity,
          WNBA has constantly been perceived as an unentertaining sport. Our team explored ways
          to change this perception and help grow WNBA's audience through a digital intervention.
       </p>


    </section>

  <section class="wow fadeIn">
      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>To gain a deeper understanding of the problem area, we conducted interviews with basketball coaches, a sports editor and basketball ethusiasts.
        We also looked for examples of what similar fields were doing to build
        audiences and maintain viewership.</p>


      <h4>Celebrating individual athletes</h4>
      <p>The NBA is largely successful because of their ability to make players into celebrities.
        The NBA has certain household names that are prevalent not only because they play well, but
        are also relatable outside the court, and have big, entertaining personalities. Rather than
        only being perceived as a team sport, we asked ourselves,</p>

        <div class="wnba-text quote"><h4>How might we celebrate the individuality of the WNBA players?</h4></div>



      <h4>Families already attend WNBA games</h4>
      <p>During our primary research we found that tickets to the WNBA games are relatively cheap and encouraged to be bought in groups. This is why many families attend the games as a form of entertainment. With an already existing audience, I advocated to the team the opportunity to target a younger demographic through an intervention that is engaging & relevant which would create a stronger bond with the players.
      </p>

    <!-- <div class="col1of2"> -->
      <h4>Cognitive overload</h4>
      <p>The current website has no content strategy making it harder for a fan to engage with the players. This creates barrier to information that should be accessible and simple to digest.
      </p>

    <h3>Revised goal</h3>
    <p>We acknowledged that sexism greatly contributed to the issue of WNBA games being perceived as unentertaining.
      However, tackling sexism was outside of the scope our project and would require a cultural shift of perception.

    <p>Based on our insights, we found an opportunity to cater our intervention towards an existing audience.
      We decided to target a younger audience between the ages of 9 and 14, because they have not yet formed solid opinions
      about the WNBA. We targeted the younger viewers that we considered are rookie fans, or those who are interested
      in the WNBA, but have not committed to the league. We chose the age group 9-14 years old because we wanted to ensure they were old enough to use or have their own mobile device.
    </p>
    <p>We reminded ourselves that we weren't directly solving the issue of ticket sales nor were we aiming for a quick return.
      We summarized our end goal to be,     </p>

    <div class="wnba-text quote"> <h4>Highlight each player, their skills, and their stories outside of basketball to foster a stronger connection between them and the rookie fans. </h4>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="wow fadeIn">
    <h3>Journey map</h3>
    <p> From our primary research of having attended local N.C.A.A. basketball game, we learnt that there is most interest in
      wanting to learn about players and their backgrounds during and after the game. We looked at ways to retain the rookies
      fans after they’ve been to a game and extend the brand loyalty to create a permanent experience. We noticed a drop off in
      engagement in the enter and extend stages but the WNBA currently isn’t making an effort to address it.

    <h3>The idea </h3>
    <div class="wnba-text quote"><h4>Using collectibles to create an added value to WNBA games, encouraging continual game attendance.</h4></div>
    <p> To encourage game attendance and to foster a stronger relationship with the WNBA players, we created an application
       that ties in basketball game and portrays lives of WNBA player outside of basketball
       that incentivizes game attendance through collectibles. These collectibles will feature items the portray the lives of the WNBA players outside of basketball.</p>
