    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p> This was a 4-week academic case study for a senior experience design course.
        For this project, we were tasked with finding a client with a business problem that was within the scope of the
        project constraints, where we as designers could come up with a meaningful digital intervention.

      <h4>RESEARCH</h4>
      <h3>Business Problem</h3>
        <p>
        Attendance and viewership of Women's National Basketball Association games has been on a steady decline since 2002, making it increasingly hard to survive as an organization.
        </p>

      </section>
      
      <h3 style="padding-top: 2em;">People Problem</h3>        
       <p>
        WNBA games is commonly perceived as unentertaining and boring, often in comparision to NBA. Our team explored ways
        to change this perception and help grow WNBA's audience and increase engagement with both existing and new audiences.
       </p>
  </section>

  <section></section>

  <section class="wow fadeIn">
    <h4>PROCESS</h4>
    <h3>Research & Insights</h3>
    <p class="space">To gain a deeper understanding of the problem area, we conducted interviews with basketball coaches, a sports editor and basketball enthusiasts.
      We also looked for examples of what similar fields were doing to build
      audiences and maintain viewership.</p>

    <h3><span style="color: #df6e00">01.</span> Celebrating Individuality</h3>
      <p class="space">The NBA is largely successful because of their ability to make players into celebrities.
        The NBA has certain household names that are prevalent not only because they play well, but
        are also relatable outside the court, and have big, entertaining personalities. Rather than
        only being perceived as a team sport, we asked ourselves,
        <strong>how might we celebrate the individuality of the WNBA players?</strong></p>

        <div class="flex">
          <h3><span style="color: #df6e00">02.</span> Cognitive Overload</h4>
            <p><strong>The current website has no content strategy </strong> making it harder for a fan to engage with the players.
              This creates barrier to information that should be accessible and simple to digest.

        <h3><span style="color: #df6e00">03.</span> Meaningful Value for Existing Customers</h4>
        <p>During our primary research we found that tickets to the WNBA games are relatively cheap and encouraged to be bought in groups.
          This is why many <span style="color: #df6e00">families attend the games as an affordable form of entertainment</span>. With an already existing audience,
          I advocated to the team the opportunity to target a younger demographic through an intervention that is engaging & relevant which
          would create a stronger bond with the players.

      <h3>Connecting With Players Through Live Games</h3>
      <p> We attended an N.C.A.A. basketball game, to gain an additional understanding of the live game experience
        and to debunk any assumptions made through our secondary research.
        The game attendees ranged from university students and parents to little league players.</p>

        We observed an interesting behaviour where the attendees would read the team roster handout before the game started
        and during the game to <span style="color: #df6e00">identify the players that stood out to them. We saw this as an opportunity to familiarize
        the players to the audience </span>. We also noticed a drop off in
        engagement after the game ended and saw the potential to create a more permanent experience beyond the live game experience.
        Designing for a cyclical journey rather than a linear one, would ensure repeat engagement with the WNBA and
        encourage families to attend more games in the future.

    <h3>Reframing for Longterm Impact</h3>
    <p>Based on our insights,<span style="color: #df6e00"> we found an opportunity to cater our intervention towards an existing audience.</span>
      We decided to target a younger audience between the ages of 9 and 14, because they have not yet formed solid opinions
      about the WNBA. We targeted the younger viewers that we considered are rookie fans, or those who are interested
      in the WNBA, but have not committed to the league. We chose the age group 9-14 years old because we wanted to ensure they were old enough to use or have their own mobile device.

    <p class="space">We reframed out initial goal of increasing ticket sales to designing an experience with a longterm impact and engagement with the WNBA culture.

      <h3>Taking Concept to Form</h4>
      <p> With our end goal set, we conducted a week long design sprint where we were able to generate form ideas,
        create our prototype and conduct user testing.
        We looked for ways to intervene before and the after attending a live WNBA game.<span style="color: #df6e00"> I took upon the role of a facilitator,
        ensuring that we kept our workflow at a rapid pace, fleshing out every form possible before converging into a polished idea. </span>

    <!-- <h3>The Idea </h3> -->
    <p class="space">By the end of the sprint, we settled with the idea of a mobile application that follows a narrative that ties
        into the context of attending a WNBA game;
      the interactions are divided into pre-game and post-game experiences.
    </p>
    <div class="wnba-text space"><h4>Use digital collectibles to create an added value to WNBA games, encouraging seasonal
      game attendance and fostering a closer connection with the players.
    </h4></div>
    <p>
      To encourage game attendance and to foster a stronger relationship with the WNBA players,
      we created an application where fans accumulate digital collectibles with every game they attend, that serves as both,
      mementos of the game and tangible connections to the players.
      These collectibles will feature items the portray the lives of the WNBA players outside of basketball.
      The overall experience with MyWNBA follows a narrative that ties into the context of attending a WNBA game; the interactions are divided into pre-game and post-game experiences.</p>

    <h3>User Testing the Prototype</h4>
      <p> While working on our prototype, we were simultaneously user-testing to validate or disprove features and value of the application.
        We were fortunate to test the prototype with 7 children between the ages 9 -14 and 4 parents that fit our persona.
        From our user-testing, we came away with the following takeaways:
      </p>
      <p><span style="color: #df6e00">01.</span> The graphic novel was our users’ favourite component of the app experience.
        They felt it was joyful, personable and favoured it over just reading text.  </p>
      <p><span style="color: #df6e00">02.</span> Users in this age group don’t buy things online, via an app.
        So we eliminated the option to make in-app merchandise purchases. </p>
      <p><span style="color: #df6e00">03.</span> Social causes the players support were more important to the parents, than to the young athletes.
        We decided to make it a more subtle part of interface.</p>

     The intent of MyWNBA is to cultivate a strong relationship between new fans and the players. As fans acquire new digital collectibles with every game attended, we are increasing the likelihood of return game attendance. In addition, the app is another touchpoint where fans can interact and engage with the WNBA, even after the game has ended. The various components of the app reveal different sides of the WNBA players, from their humble beginnings, to their athletic prowess and social involvement. MyWNBA presents the players as admirable figures, inspiring and empowering young athletes.
