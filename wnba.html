      <p> This was a 4-week long hypothetical case study that came out of a senior level experience design course.
        The project was done in collaboration with my teammates -Phoebe Lim, Jenny Nguyen, Christy Lum, Jessica Huang.
        For this project, we were tasked with finding a client with a business problem that was within the scope of the
        project constraints, where we as designers could come up with a meaningful digital intervention.

      <h3>Women's National Basketball Association</h3>
        <p>
          Attendance & viewership of WNBA
          games has been on a steady decline since 2002,
          making it increasingly hard to survive as an organization.
          Despite women's college basketball and NBA's popularity,
          <strong>WNBA has constantly been perceived as an unentertaining sport. Our team explored ways
          to change this perception and help grow WNBA's audience through a digital intervention.</strong>

    </section>

    <section>
    <p>To gain a deeper understanding of the problem area, we conducted interviews with basketball coaches, a sports editor and basketball ethusiasts.
      We also looked for examples of what similar fields were doing to build
      audiences and maintain viewership.</p>

    <h4>RESEARCH</h4>
    <h3>Celebrating individuality</h4>
      <p>The NBA is largely successful because of their ability to make players into celebrities.
        The NBA has certain household names that are prevalent not only because they play well, but
        are also relatable outside the court, and have big, entertaining personalities. Rather than
        only being perceived as a team sport, we asked ourselves,
        <strong>how might we celebrate the individuality of the WNBA players?</strong></p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <!-- <div class="col1of2"> -->
      <h3>Cognitive overload</h4>
      <p>The current website has no content strategy making it harder for a fan to engage with the players. This creates barrier to information that should be accessible and simple to digest.

    <section>
        <h3>Existing customers</h4>
        <p>During our primary research we found that tickets to the WNBA games are relatively cheap and encouraged to be bought in groups. This is why many families attend the games as a form of entertainment. With an already existing audience, I advocated to the team the opportunity to target a younger demographic through an intervention that is engaging & relevant which would create a stronger bond with the players.

      <h3>Live basketball game experience</h3>
      <p> We attended an N.C.A.A. basketball game, to gain an additional understanding of the live game experience
        and to debunk any assumptions made through our secondary research.
        The game attendees ranged from university students and parents to little league players.</p>

        We observed an interesting behaviour where the attendees would read the team roster handout before the game started
        and during the game to identify the players that stood out to them. We saw this as an opportunity to familiarize
        the players to the audience. We also noticed a drop off in
        engagement after the game ended and saw the potential to create a more permanent experience beyond the live game experience.

    <h3>Revised goal</h3>
    <p>We acknowledged that sexism greatly contributed to the issue of WNBA games being perceived as unentertaining.
      However, tackling sexism was outside of the scope our project and would require a cultural shift of perception.

    <p>Based on our insights, <strong>we found an opportunity to cater our intervention towards an existing audience.</strong>
      We decided to target a younger audience between the ages of 9 and 14, because they have not yet formed solid opinions
      about the WNBA. We targeted the younger viewers that we considered are rookie fans, or those who are interested
      in the WNBA, but have not committed to the league. We chose the age group 9-14 years old because we wanted to ensure they were old enough to use or have their own mobile device.
    </p>
    <img src="img/wnba/persona.png" width="100%">
    <p>We reminded ourselves that we weren't directly solving the issue of ticket sales nor were we aiming for a quick return.
      We summarized our end goal to be,     </p>

    <div class="wnba-text quote"> <h4>Highlight each player, their skills, and their stories outside of basketball to foster a stronger connection between them and the rookie fans. </h4>

      <h4>IDEATION</h4>
      <h3>Taking concept to form</h4>
      <p> With our end goal set, we conducted a week long design sprint where we were able to generate form ideas,
        create our prototype and conduct user testing.
        We looked for ways to intervene before and the after attending a live WNBA game. I took upon the role of a facilitator,
        ensuring that we kept our workflow at a rapid pace, fleshing out every form possible before converging into a polished idea.

    <p>By the end of the sprint, we settled with the idea of a mobile application that follows a narrative that ties
        into the context of attending a WNBA game;
      the interactions are divided into pre-game and post-game experiences.

    <h3>The idea </h3>
    <div class="wnba-text quote"><h4>Using collectibles to create an added value to WNBA games, encouraging seasonal
      game attendance and fostering a closer connection with the players.
    </h4></div>
    <p>
      To encourage game attendance and to foster a stronger relationship with the WNBA players,
      we created an application where fans accumulate digital collectibles with every game they attend, that serves as both,
      mementos of the game and tangible connections to the players.
      These collectibles will feature items the portray the lives of the WNBA players outside of basketball.
      The overall experience with MyWNBA follows a narrative that ties into the context of attending a WNBA game; the interactions are divided into pre-game and post-game experiences.</p>

       <p>The locker room is a commonplace for many young fans as they may also interact with their peers in this familiar

   <h3>Impact</h3>
     <p>
     The intent of MyWNBA is to cultivate a strong relationship between new fans and the players. As fans acquire new digital collectibles with every game attended, we are increasing the likelihood of return game attendance. In addition, the app is another touchpoint where fans can interact and engage with the WNBA, even after the game has ended. The various components of the app reveal different sides of the WNBA players, from their humble beginnings, to their athletic prowess and social involvement. MyWNBA presents the players as admirable figures, inspiring and empowering young athletes.
