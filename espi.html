        <div class="small-text"><h3>CONTEXT</h3></div>
        <p>This project was created within a design research course where the focus was learning ethnographic
           research methods.
          We had the opportunity to work with the <a href="http://www.vtsl.com/">Vancouver Theatre Sports League</a>
          over the span of 3 months with frequent meetings to create a final proposal that included a prototype,
           a video proposal, and research document.
        </p>

      <div class="col2of2">
        <div class="small-text"><h3>ROLE</h3></div>
        <p>In this team project, my specific roles included <strong>field research, developing insights, conducting interviews,
          and contributing towards developing the UI and interactions </strong>. Primary tools I used were Sketch, Principle, Photoshop, and Illustrator. </p>

        <h3>  Context & Role</h3>

       <p>
         One the busiest airports in Europe, <a href="https://www.schiphol.nl/en/page/trial-border-passage-based-on-facial-recognition-cathay-pacific/">
         Amsterdam Schiphol Airport </a> tasked Edenspiekermann with improving passenger journey
         and creating a seamless experience from check-in to boarding. Using facial recognition technology,
         we aimed to reduce the number of steps it takes passengers to get through each checkpoint at the airport.
         This will allow passengers to self-process, without having to repeatedly show travelling documents.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the opportunity to conceptualize passenger flows, design error handling flows, prototype solutions and
        live test my proposals through several pilots.

      <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <p>
        Designing for a complex environment like an international airport warranted a systemic design approach
        where I aimed to understand how elements fit together to form a whole.
        As this was my first design internship, I learnt what it meant to design with real world constraints and felt
        challenged to foresee the implications of every design decision. I was also challenged to be inclusive in every
        decision as airport passengers encompasses an array of demographics- individual travellers, couples, families,
        non-english speakers, height differences, non-passport holders etc.
        </p>
        <p>
        In my design process, it became clear to me how important it is to ground every decision in user research and feedback.
        Despite efforts to approach design objectively, I realized how my process is always the result of learned patterns and familiarity.
        Conducting user testing made me realize how I  make assumptions to fill in a mental image for the context I am designing for.
        During the user testing, I found several of my design decisions disproved or validated and also learnt passenger behaviours that I hadn’t considered in my ideation process.
        </p>

        <p>
        Due to the NDA nature of the project, I’m not able to publicly share my work. Please feel free to get in touch with me for more details.
        I also wrote <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/what-i-didnt-learn-in-school-119f03f2bec">an article</a> reflecting on my internship experience
        at Edenspiekermann. Feel free to take a read ☻
